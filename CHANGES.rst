2.0.0 (Unreleased)
==================
- [FIX] Fixed the handling of empty views in the DesignDocument.
- [BREAKING] Fixed CloudantDatabase.share_database to accept all valid permission roles.  Changed the method signature to accept roles as a list argument.

Also renamed the CloudantDatabase convenience methods of get_all_indexes, create_index, and delete_index as get_query_indexes, create_query_index, and delete_query_index respectively.  These changes were made to clarify that the changed class and the changed methods were specific to query index processing only.
